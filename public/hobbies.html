        <h2>Play Video Games</h2>
        <p>After work, I like to unwind by playing PC or console games to relieve stress. My taste in games is pretty varied, ranging from FPS like Valorant to horror games like Phasmophobia. I find that gaming is even more enjoyable when I'm playing with friends. In fact, this is what sparked my interest in programming again! </p>

        <h2>Read books</h2>
        <p>I love reading series books like Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, the Twilight Saga, and Game of Thrones. For me, there's something truly special about getting lost in a story and imagining what it would be like to be part of that world. Reading is definitely one of my favorite pastimes!</p>
